        <h1>FP8: Describe your Data</h1>
        <h5>By Tom Lucy and Duncan Gans, 11/17/17</h5>
        <p>Project Name: Political Advertisements in the 2015-2016 Election
        Cycle</p>
        <p>The dataset we are using for this project was obtained from
        Government & Legal Studies Professor Michael Franz. The initial
        dataset contained information on all political ads, at both the state
        and federal levels, in the years 2015-2016. For our project, we will
        be focusing on solely US Senate, US House, and Presidential races -
        excluding ads for justice and gubernatorial races. In this subset of
        the data, there are about 303298 examples and 23 attributes.</p>
        <p>Of the attributes that we are including, 6 are real values  and the
        other 17 are catergorical. Rather than encoding categorical
        attributes, we are aggregating the data in the ways that we want to
        use it. Since our questions and visualizationts care more about
        trends in ads across time, we are much more interested in how many
        ads were run for US Senate races than the specifics of any particular
        US Senate ad.</p>
        <br>
	These are the attributes in the dataset:
	<br>
	<ol>
	  <li>L: Length of the political ad in seconds [real values]</li>
	  <li>MARKET: The media market of the country in which the ad was run
            (e.g. Houston, Salt Lake, etc) [categorical]</li>
	  <li>DISTRICT: The political district in which the race is occuring
            (e.g Mississippi 1st) [categorical]</li>
	  <li>MEDIA: Type of media on which the ad was run (e.g. Spot TV)
	    [categorical]</li>
	  <li>AIRDATE: Date that the ad was run (1/1/15 - 12/31/16) [real
	    values]</li>
	  <li>AIRTIME: Time of day that the ad was run (00:00:00 - 23:59:59)
            [real values]</li>
	  <li>DAY: General time of day that the ad was run, based off the time

            [real values]</li>
	  <li>ADTYPE: General type of ad (e.g. election, referendum, etc)
	  [categorical]</li>
	  <li>AFFILIATION: Party affiliated with the creator/sponsor of the ad
	    [categorical]</li>
	  <li>ELECTION: Election type of the ad that is being run
            (e.g. General) [categorical]</li>
	  <li>ISSUE: Issues on which the ad is focused (e.g. Veterans, Taxes,
            etc) [categorical]</li>
	  <li>LEVEL: Level of the race for which the ad was made (e.g. local,
            national, etc) [categorical]</li>
	  <li>RACE: Race that the ad was for (e.g. US House, US Senate, etc)
	    [categorical]</li>
	  <li>TONE: General tone of the ad (e.g. Positive, Contrast, Negative)
	    [categorical]</li>
	  <li>YEAR: Year in which the ad was made [real values]</li>
	  <li>NIELSENMAID: Number of the nielsen area in which the ad was
            run [real values]</li>

	</ol>
	<p>Although we have inclduded all of the attributes at this point, not
          all will be used. The most important attributes to us are RACE,
          EST. COST, ISSUE, TONE, and DATE, although other attributes may be
          incorporated if they are deemed applicable to the questions that we
          are trying to answer.</p>
