	<h1>Final Project: Homework 1</h1>
	<h5>By Tom Lucy and Duncan Gans, 10/31/17</h5>
	<p>Project Name: Campaign Ads in State-Level Races</p>
	<p>The collaborator for this project is Michael Michael Franz. He has
	supplied us with an all-encompassing dataset that provides information
	on all political advertisements run in the US since the 2000s. To
	narrow this down slightly, we are choosing to focus on only examples
	from state-level races, not national or local races.</p>
	<p>Political advertisements are a huge part of campaigns and
	elections, especially since Citizens United, and have become a staple
	of the American electoral process. Seeing how the nature of political
	advertisements has changed over time, across different electoral
	regions, can give us insights into the change of the political
	atmosphere as a whole.</p>
	<p>Columns include: negativity (tone of ad), issue matter, length,
	cost, market, affiliate station (channel aired on), among others. From
	these attributes, we have the ability to answer a lot of interesting
	questions about the data and about political advertisments.</p>
	<h4>Brainstorming Questions:</h4>
	<ol>
	  <li>How has the tone of ads changed over time?</li>
	  <li>What issues matter to which voters where?</li>
	  <li>Do certain tv channels favor one political ideologies ads over
	  the others?</li>
	  <li>Are certain races (gubernatorial, senate, house) more civil
	  thans others?</li>
	  <li>What issues do certain parties push?</li>
	  <li>Is either party more negative?</li>
	  <li>Are swing states more likely to have negative advertising?</li>
	  <li>Where is it expensive to have political ads?</li>
	  <li>In what races are there longer political ads?</li>
	  <li>Does one party consistenly spend more than the other in
	  ads?</li>
	</ol>
