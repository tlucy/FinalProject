  <h3>Political Advertisements During the 2015-2016 Election Cycle</h3>
  <p> This goal of this work is to visualize, and in doing so, answer questions about the political advertisement atmosphere of the 2015-2016 election cycle. Working with Professor Franz, we have a collection of all the political ads that ran in the 2015-16 election cycle, and will be focusing on the presidential, US Senate, and US House elections. Political ads are a huge part of Political Campaigns and our electoral process. Every year, candidates spend millions of dollars attempting to sway individuals into their camp. Although almost every candidate will air political ads, the nature of these ads varies widely. From the negativity of an ad, to the issue positions in an ad, to the length and cost, no two ads are the same. These ads vary for a reason. Some ads work better than others, and depending on who the target audience is, or what the specific goal is, the best type of ad will vary. Our goal is to investigate these differences. By creating an interactive data visualization of the 2015-16 political ad atmosphere, we can hope to answer these questions, and shed light on the wide variety of ads.

  The data itself is wonderfully extensive. Each political ad details when and where it took place, what type of race it was for, and the nature of the ad, everything from its positivity to the issues it conveys. Each specific ad is a small treasure of information. In doing this project, we want to be able to help users answer questions about what political ads look like at certain times and locations in the 2015-2016 election. Questions like "What parts of the country air more positive ads?", "Do certain parties focus more on certain issues in their ads?", and "How do Primary Election ads differ from General Election Ads?". By showing how both location and time influences political advertisements, and letting users focus on a wide variety of variables, we will be able to avoid shutting doors, and truly let the user answer the questions they want to be answered.
