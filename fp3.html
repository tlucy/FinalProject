	<h1>Final Project: Homework 3</h1>
	<h5>By Tom Lucy and Duncan Gans, 11/8/17</h5>
	<p>Project Name: Campaign Ads in US House & Senate Races</p>
	<p>The dataset we are using for this project was obtained from
	Government & Legal Studies Professor Michael Franz. The initial
	dataset contained information on all political ads, at both the state
	and federal levels, in the years 2015-2016. For our project, we will
	be focusing on solely US Senate, US House, and Presidential races - excluding ads for
	justice and gubernatorial races. In this subset of the data,
	there are about 303298 examples and around 18 attributes that we
	may use. There are another 5 attributes that could possibly be used,
	but we have not yet made plans to incorporate them. All additional
	attributes have been tossed.</p>
	<p>Of the attributes that we are including, 4 are real values, 1 is a
	time value, and the other 13 are catergorical. For many of the
	categorical values, we are likely to encode them - but we have yet to
	do that, decide how we would do that, or decide for which
	visualizations it makes sense to do that.</p>
