FP11-1: Final Project Progress Report - 1

Our goals for this week were to finish all of the Final Project Assignments, 
FP4-FP11. These have now all been submitted (except for fp11, which is this 
very document.) Because we have not gotten an official approval of our project
we have not yet started working on the actual code. 

In FP10 we outlined our goals for the project, as well as our week by week
goals. So, we feel like these week by week goals are very manageable and 
because the week of November 20th hasn't started yet, there is not a lot
to write about in this document. We met with our collaborator, and he was
very optimistic. This can be seen in fp7. We haven't ran into any new questions
or problems that we didn't voice in the previous Final Project documents we
submitted earlier today. 

Our most immediate goals for the next week are to get a minimally functional
layout for our visualization. This will include the two graphs (the 
chloropleth and the bar graph) as well as space for the future interactivity.
Additionally, we will begin pre-processing data to make it amenable to the 
time scrolling interactivity. 

Also, according to the assignment this should be two pages, but we are unsure
what to write about for this first progress report. To add more information 
would be to simply copy and paste it from other documents, especially FP10. 
If you want us to do more, let us know. An updated contributions account is in
the project directory.
