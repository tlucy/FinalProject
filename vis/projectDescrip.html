      <p> The goal of this work is to visualize, and in doing so, answer
	questions  about the political advertisement atmosphere of the
	2015-2016 election cycle. Working with Professor Franz of the Bowdoin
	College Government and Legal Studies Department, we have a
	collection of all the political ads that ran in the 2015-16 election
	cycle, and will be focusing on the presidential, US Senate, and US
	House elections. Political ads are a huge part of Political Campaigns
	and our electoral process. Every year, candidates spend millions of
	dollars attempting to sway individuals into their camp. Although
	almost every candidate will air political ads, the nature of these ads
	varies widely. From the negativity of an ad, to the issue positions in
	an ad, to the length and cost, no two ads are the same. These ads vary
	for a reason. Some ads work better than others, and depending on who
	the target audience is, or what the specific goal is, the best type of
	ad will vary. Our goal is to investigate these differences. By
	creating an interactive data visualization of the 2015-16 political ad
	atmosphere, we can hope to answer these questions, and shed light on
	the wide variety of ads.</p>
      <p>The data itself is wonderfully extensive. Each political ad details
	when and where it took place, what type of race it was for, and the
	nature of the ad, everything from its positivity to the issues it
	conveys. Each specific ad is a small treasure of information. In doing
	this project, we want to be able to help users answer questions about
	what political ads look like at certain times and locations in the
	2015-2016 election. Questions like "What parts of the country air more
	positive ads?", "Do certain parties focus more on certain issues in
	their ads?", and "How do Primary Election ads differ from General
	Election Ads?". By showing how both location and time influences
	political advertisements, and letting users focus on a wide variety of
	variables, we will be able to avoid shutting doors, and truly let the
	user answer the questions they want to be answered.</p>
