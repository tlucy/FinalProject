      <p>A Project by Tom Lucy and Duncan Gans, Fall 2017</p>

    <p>The dataset we are using for this project was obtained from
      Government & Legal Studies Professor Michael Franz. The initial
      dataset contained information on all political ads, at both the state
      and federal levels, in the years 2015-2016. For our project, we will
      be focusing on solely US Senate, US House, and Presidential races -
      excluding ads for justice and gubernatorial races. In this subset of
      the data, there are about 303298 examples and 23 attributes.</p>
    <p>Of the attributes that we are including, 6 are real values  and the
      other 17 are catergorical. Rather than encoding categorical
      attributes, we are aggregating the data in the ways that we want to
      use it. Since our questions and visualizationts care more about
      trends in ads across time, we are much more interested in how many
      ads were run for US Senate races than the specifics of any particular
      US Senate ad.</p>
    <p>These are the attributes in the dataset:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>L: Length of the political ad in seconds [real values]</li>
      <li>MARKET: The media market of the country in which the ad was run
        (e.g. Houston, Salt Lake, etc) [categorical]</li>
      <li>DISTRICT: The political district in which the race is occuring
        (e.g Mississippi 1st) [categorical]</li>
      <li>MEDIA: Type of media on which the ad was run (e.g. Spot TV)
	[categorical]</li>
      <li>AIRDATE: Date that the ad was run (1/1/15 - 12/31/16) [real
	values]</li>
      <li>AIRTIME: Time of day that the ad was run (00:00:00 - 23:59:59)
        [real values]</li>
      <li>DAY: General time of day that the ad was run, based off the time
	[categorical]</li>
      <li>PART: Genre of the channel on which the ad was run

      <li>STATION: Channel on which the ad was run [categorical]</li>

        ran the ad is affiliated [categorical]</li>
      <li>PROGRAM: Name of the program during which that ad was run
	[categorical]</li>
      <li>PROGRAMTYPE: Genre of the program during which the ad was run

        (e.g. General) [categorical]</li>

      <li>LEVEL: Level of the race for which the ad was made (e.g. local,
        national, etc) [categorical]</li>

	[categorical]</li>
      <li>TONE: General tone of the ad (e.g. Positive, Contrast, Negative)

      <li>YEAR: Year in which the ad was made [real values]</li>
      <li>NIELSENMAID: Number of the nielsen area in which the ad was
        run [real values]</li>
