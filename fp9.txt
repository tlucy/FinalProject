FP9: Notes from in-class pilot studies

Dataset Overview: Data on advertisements ran for US House, US Senate, and
Presidential races between 2015-2016.

1. The Line Graph
   - This visualization shows how total cost spent on advertisements changes
   over time in 2015-2016. Generally a line graph could answer the following
   questions: how did spending change over time?; which periods saw the most
   spending? which events in the election cycle corresponded with higher
   levels of spending? Found here:

   - Observations:
     - Brush and Zoom would be good interactivity to show more specific time
     periods 
     - sort by US House, US Senate, and Presidential races - different line
     for each (stacked area)
     - sort by Republicans and Democrats
     - put in line for dates of primaries/primary season

2. The Sankey Diagram
   - This visualization shows total ads, number of democrat vs republican ads
   vs other ads, and then how many from each party were positive, negative,
   and contrasting in tone. Attempts to answer: How do the parties compare in
   the tone of ads? Found here:
   http://www.bowdoin.edu/~tlucy/csci3665/FinalProject/fp6/sankey.html
   - Observations:
     - Add tooltips with percent of previous layer for links
     - Add a layer after party for 'Issues'
     - 3d drop down to choose layers?

3. The Chloropleth
   - This visualization shows tone of ads by state (more negative are more
   red). Possible interactions are: showing cost, station, etc instead of
   tone and animating to show changes over time. Attempts to answer: Which
   states see more negative ads? Which can lead to a more educated discusiion
   of why. Found here:
   http://www.bowdoin.edu/~tlucy/csci3665/FinalProject/fp6/chl.html
   - Observations:
     - Add legend and animation
     - Add more distinct lines to the map to differentiate states
     - Add state's names to the map as labels

4. The Bar Graph
   - This visualization shows total cost over the time period by issue, with
   envisioned interactivity to show by party, station, or type of
   race. Attempts to answer: Which issues are worth more money to campaigns,
   and which issues are worth more money to parties? Found here:
   http://www.bowdoin.edu/~tlucy/csci3665/FinalProject/fp6/bg.html
   - Observations:
     - Stack the bars to show each party
     - Have the color reflect the party
     - Run side by side with chloropleth in an animation
